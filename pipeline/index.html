## What are you building?
]

???

* Before we go into details on _how_ to achieve contributor growth, take a moment to be intentional about it.
* What are you trying to achieve? Community around the project? Finding the next maintainer? Wider range of skills and perspectives?
* Be honest with what time and energy you have to give.
* Who else is committed to making this happen with you?

---

.white[
## Where do contributors come from?
]

---

class: center

## Individual Users

* They use it, or develop with it
* Sometimes: really excited
* Sometimes: want to fix something specific
* Usually power/production users

---

class: center

## Corporate Users

* Their company depends on it
* Sometimes: come to fix something
* Sometimes: come to maintain

---

class: center

## Learners

* Want to learn the language, OR
* Want to learn the tech, OR
* Want to beef up resume

---

class: center

## Who do you want to join?

* People new to the project? Existing users?
* Can you offer mentoring?
* Are you lacking contributors with specific skills?  
  Project Management, Technical Writing, Design
* Experienced maintainers and programmers to help run the project?

???

* Understand who you are looking for and make sure your welcome mat includes them!
* Targeting everything at once is usually too much.
* Evaluate your capacity to on-board

TODO: call out non-code contributors!  Docs, user stories, blog, design, event management

---

class: center

## Enablers

.left[
.grid[
.col[
.green[Low Investment:]
* contributing.md
* build docs
* contrib list/chat
* public dev meetings
* newsletter
* contrib ladder
* dev roadmap
]

.col[
.green[High Investment:]
* contrib tutorial
* contributor hours
* live workshops
* hackathons
* mentoring programs
* live test env
]
]
]

???

* Make sure to mention the public communication of roadmap and current dev priorities
* Published governance demonstrates that there isn’t a glass ceiling, even if there’s just one maintainer right now

---

class: center

## Recognition!

* digital badges
* swag
* public thank you

???

class: center

## Blockers

* CLA
* no/slow repo rights
* unclear/hostile governance
* difficult merge process
* opaque tests
* slow/no reviews
* usurping PRs

???

* These are things that will turn away contributors

---

class: center

## What’s most valuable

1. Written asynchronous communications  
  Mailing List, Blog, Discussion Forum
2. Developer Meeting
3. Office Hours / End-User Forum
4. Community Meetings work better in other formats

???

* Meetings with no content/action items/activities should be blog posts.
* Synchronous activity is expensive, least attended
* Users show up to get access to core developers

---

class: center

## Communications

???

TODO: include catherine's advice
dev meetings include strategy
set expectations around response times

---

class: center

## Set your expectations

.grid[
.col.double[
* Pick what makes sense for your project
* Focus initially on what helps you scale
* Try one at a time
]

.col[

???

We are listing _everything_ that you can do, it’s not everything that every project _should_ do.

## Community must advertise

.grid[
.col.double[
* Readme
* Contributing Guide / Landing Page
* Good First Issues
* Events/talks
]

.col[
<img src="img/honeyjar.jpg" alt="Jar of honey, with a honey dipper" width="200px" />
]
]

???

* People don’t always know to look for a contributing.md but everyone sees your readme. Let people know that you want contributors.
* These documents set the tone for your project and impacts if people feel welcome
* When a new contributor takes a peek at the contributing.md, they aren’t just looking for _how_ to contribute, but a feel for if your project is a good match.

## Example Readme

alt="Screenshot of the Porter readme. Looking for Contributors. What to work on Porter with us? We are actively seeking out new contributors with the hopes of building up both casual contributors and enticing some of you into becoming reviewers and maintainers. Start with our New Contributors Guide."

## Example Landing Page

<a href="https://porter.sh/contribute/" target="_blank">

## Help Wanted Label

* Low Barrier to Entry
* Clear Task
* Medium to Low Priority
* Up to Date
* May be looking for specialized skills

???

An issue that needs specialized knowledge that may not necessarily be domain specific to the project, e.g. people who know windows, or front-end design or networking

---

class: center

## Good First Issue Label

* No Barrier to Entry
* Issue Provides Enough Context
* Solution Explained in Issue
* Gives Examples to Copy and Modify
* Identifies Relevant Code
* Ready to Test

---

class: center

## Example Good First Issue

<a href="https://github.com/getporter/porter/issues/1407" target="_blank">
  <img src="img/example-porter-good-first-issue.png" width="80%"
  alt="Screenshot of a github issue in Porter. It has step by step instructions and links to relevant code."
  />
</a>

---

class: center

## Perpetual Good First Issue

* New contributors have a unique (and temporary) perspective
* Get feedback on documentation and new user experience
* If they can open a PR for problems found, even better!

???

* CAROLYN:
* Encourage new contributors to add to the new contributor guide, they have a perspective that you can’t replicate
* Have them run through “cold” without immediate help from you to spot gaps and communication problems

---

class: center

## Onboarding

.grid[
.col.double[
* Contributing Guide
  * Environment Set up
  * Contributing Tutorial
  * Project Tutorials
* First Pull Request Experience
]

.col[
<img src="img/welcome-aboard.jpg" width="300px"
      alt="Person standing in front of a welcome mat that says Welcome Aboard"
/>
]
]

???

Goal: Someone can make their first pull request without playing 20 questions
Help them help themselves
Get reviewers on the same page for how they are expected to help new contributors
It’s okay to set boundaries

class: center

## Teaching Mediums

* Text first. More accessible.
* Videos, keep them small. You will re-record as things change
* In-person is the least scalable

  />
</a>

---

class: center

## Contributor Ladder

* Outline project roles and how to achieve them
* Consider roles you need but don’t have yet
* Agree on how contributors can earn trust
* Shows people that there is a path to maintainer

???

Don’t compare against the original creators of the project
It’s okay to limit scope of responsibility
